# reserveUW

ReserveUW mimicks the facilities reservation system at the University of Waterloo but is designed with a Microservices architecture instead. The project was built after completing Stephen Grider's microservices course with Node.js on Udemy. This project is intended as a personal learning experience to help me reimplement what I learnt in the course myself
